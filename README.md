Task 2: Temperature converter

I've successfully completed Task 2 of my internship with Bharat Intern. This task involved building a Temperature Converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Highlights:
Using HTML I've created an intuitive interface featuring input areas for both Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures, accompanied by a button labeled 'Convert.'
Using CSS I've crafted the converter's design to be visually enticing and user-friendly, prioritizing a fantastic user experience.
Using JavaScript I've developed the logic to seamlessly transform temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, ensuring precise outcomes in real-time.
